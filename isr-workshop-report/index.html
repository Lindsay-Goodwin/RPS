      <div class="note">
        Incoherent Scatter Radars (ISRs, also referred to as Thomson Scatter
        Radars) represent a powerful intersection of scientific innovation and
        engineering excellence. For over six decades, these sophisticated
        instruments have provided the space physics community with uniquely
        valuable observations of the ionosphere across a broad range of
        altitudes, latitudes, and time scalesâ€”from fleeting seconds to entire
        solar cycles. These observations have contributed to significant
        advances in fundamental plasma physics, space weather, and
        magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The uniqueness of modern ISR
        observations is an overlay of many individual strengths:
        height-resolution, configurable beam profiles, multi-angle simultaneous
        observing for retrieval of plasma parameters and derived vector
        quantities within a general region, and the capability of functioning
        regardless of cloud cover or time of day.
        <p><em> </em></p>
        Despite their scientific value, there is a growing concern amongst the
        scientific community that ISRs are becoming under-utilized. The
        complexity of radar operations, the opaque nature of data processing,
        and a lack of accessible training and resources have led to a decline in
        engagement, particularly among students and early-career researchers. At
        the same time, the number of operational US-backed ISRs available to the
        community is declining, with no clear plan to replace, revitalize, or
        build new systems.
        <p><em> </em></p>
        To address these pressing issues, a 2024 ISR Community and Research
        Workshop was convened at the Wyndham San Diego Bayside June 8 - 9, 2024,
        hosted by the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). The primary
        focuses of this workshop were to: 1) Assess the size and state of the
        community, 2) Develop a roadmap for training the radar community and the
        broader space physics community, 3) Provide a platform for disseminating
        research specific to the radar community, and 4) unify the US ISR
        community in order to be able to confront current and future problems in
        the field.
